    <h3>Program Specialist, 2010 - 2012</h3>
    <p class="lead">After conducting an evaluation of GSOSW travel programs, I identified information access as a strategic issue for the council. This was due to a major organizational restructuring that resulted in fragmented programs with missing info and incomplete or conflicting instructions.</p>

    <p class="lead">To address this, I gathered and organized information, worked with volunteers to sort out what info was mising, and researched new or changed policies. I then developed documents outlining accurate and complete information as well as training materials to ensure that consistent and accurate information was available to volunteers and staff.

    <p class="lead">I recruited, interviewed and hired and supervised a diverse 50-person AmeriCorps team working in over 10 different elementary schools across the state of Washington.</p>

    <h4>Washington Reading Corps Blog</h4>
    <p class="lead">I created this blog as a tool to communicate with the community, other members, and state and federal AmeriCorps agencies what our team was doing. I helped members write about thier experiences as reading tutors so the content was always fresh and meaningful.  While it is noticeably out of date, you can get an idea of what it was.
